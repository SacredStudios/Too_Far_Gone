# Too_Far_Gone
Far-out RPG Adventure
Fun RPG game I'm making with Unity. It's turning out a lot better than I thought.
Then I was thinking... Like what if my computer bricks or something. Then my countless hours of work was all for nothing! So I decided to *finally* back it up

Also, I never liked the intrusiveness of the name "readme" files. Like no, you don't have to read them. Most of them just has worthless info you would've found out anyways. I mean readmes just waste your time, right?

But not this readme, this one definitely did not waste your time.
